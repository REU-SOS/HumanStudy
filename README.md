# Human Studies Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to learn about a few different user study methods, [see handout](https://github.com/REU-SOS/HumanStudy/blob/master/handout.pdf), practice being in a controlled study, and plan and pilot your own user study! 

### Practice Controlled Study

1) Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/REU-SOS/HumanStudy.git
```

2) Run viewer.jar:

```
java -jar Viewer.jar
```

3) If you have the Beacons condition, load the Beacons.xml. If you are in the Layout condition, load the Layout.xml

4) Follow the instructions. You will be shown a code snippet, asked to re-implement it from memory, and shown the code snippet again. Later on you will be asked to correctly identify a code snippet that will obfuscated, which will test your ability to use pattern matching for identifying the code. 

5) Submit your "answers.xml" and fill out survey [here](http://checkbox.io/studies/?id=577d17f5bd9fe3a30f000002).
To locate the file, look in NoExperimentCode_ID/answers.xml, where ID is the name you entered at the start.

6) Let's reflect on what we might learn from a study like this. 

  * What research questions may we be interested in?
  * What are some observations we may see?
  * What are some things we could change in expertiment?

### User Study Planning

Think about a user study you might want to run for your research now or in the future.
Get the [study plan worksheet](https://github.com/REU-SOS/HumanStudy/blob/master/testplan.pdf).
Try filling out study plan questions, then we'll discuss them in a group.

### User Study Replanned

As a group, think of a really simple expertiment you could do right now. Logistics is everything in a user study. You'll be amazed about all the details that come up!

### Pilot

Try executing a pilot with users from a different group. Hilarity ensues.
